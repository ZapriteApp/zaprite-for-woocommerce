**Accept Bitcoin and Lightning**

Start accepting Bitcoin, Lightning and Liquid today â€” Powered by Zaprite.

This plugin allows stores that use WordPress WooCommerce shopping cart system to

_In order to use this plugin you have to create an account on
[https://app.zaprite.com](https://app.zaprite.com)_

## Installation

1. Upload the zipped `zaprite-payment-gateway` folder to the
   `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or in Plugins > Add New > Upload).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments.
4. Click on 'Zaprite' to configure the payment gateway settings.

## Local development

### With Docker

To develop locally, you can run WordPress locally with docker. This will run
WordPress on port 8000 with debugging enabled. It will also mount your local
`./zaprite-payment-gateway` directly in the WordPress `plugins` directory so
that you can edit and see the result of your changes directly in WordPress.

First, you'll need to run the docker containers:

```
cd wordpress-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

Then you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have [`zaprite-v2`](https://github.com/ZapriteApp/zaprite-v2)
   project running on http://localhost:3000
1. `open http://localhost:8000`
1. Follow the WordPress installation instructions
1. Install and configure the WooCommerce plugin:
   http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?s=woocommerce&tab=search&type=term
1. Add a product in woo commerce so that you can test payments
1. Activate Zaprite plugin: http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/plugins.php
1. Configure zaprite plugin:
   http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout&section=zaprite
    1. Check "Enable payments via Zaprite Checkout"
    1. Enter your Zaprite API key

You can now test the plugin by creating an order in your shop:
http://localhost:8000/shop/

### Without Docker

If you prefer using another way to run WordPress locally, like
[Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/), you can clone this git repo anywhere
you want then just create a symlink to the `plugin` directory:

```
ln -s <path to the cloned repo>/zaprite-for-woocommerce/plugin <path to local wordpress>/wp-content/plugins/zaprite-payment-gateway
```

Currenly there is no way to manage env variables if you use Locals by Flywheel,
and there appears to be timing issues if you use the wp-config.php file. So to
test locally edit `zaprite-payment-gateway.php`

```php
define('ZAPRITE_APP_URL', getenv('ZAPRITE_APP_URL') ? getenv('ZAPRITE_APP_URL') : 'http://localhost:3000' );
```

Also make sure you turn on debugging: Edit the `wp-config.php` File. Look for
the line that says `define('WP_DEBUG', false);`. If it's not there, you'll need
to add it. And change it to true. Then restart your site. This should create a
debug.log file in `wp-content`

# Block Checkout

If you want to edit the UI for the Blocks checkout you need to compile the
javascript code:

1. cd plugin
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm run start`
5. This will run webpack and generate files to `assets/js/frontend/blocks.js`
   and `assets/js/frontend/blocks_assets.php`. After you see success
   `webpack 5.89.0 compiled successfully in 27 ms` and can cntl+x
6. Now you can use the plugin like normal
7. If you want to update the javascript/html for the payment checkout UI then
   modify `resources/js/frontend/index.js` and run `npm run start`

\*\* if you get errors with php `composer` you might have to install it via
`brew install composer`
